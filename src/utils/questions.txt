- what is the FILE type and can I just use integers to represent and input/output stream?
- should strcat and strcpy be void * instead of char *
- can unistd.h and fcntl.h be included or are the part of the standard library
- do error functions need to be implemented
- what does background process mean?
- is naming scheme alright? (_functionName)
- should we be using register variables
- should we be using mem methods instead of str methods?
- are we allowed to include stdlib.h as long as we only use system call
wrappers and builtin types?
- can we initialize arrays like char line[1024]
path 
jobs

sigchld

linked list of child processes (not a queue since child processes don't
necessarily operate with first in first out logic)
parent receives signal from terminated child with sigchld to clear it
from the process table for background processes
