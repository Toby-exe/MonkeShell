- what is the FILE type and can I just use integers to represent and input/output stream?
- should strcat and strcpy be void * instead of char *
- can unistd.h and fcntl.h be included or are the part of the standard library
- do error functions need to be implemented
- what does background process mean?
- is naming scheme alright? (_functionName)
